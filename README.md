## Academic Title - "USV-Lir Micro: bit Sensor Pod Abstraction"

## Commercial Title - "Micro:Bit Sensor Pod breakout Board"

This project carries on from the work done by the students of the SETU Applied robotics lab.

The purpose of this project is to enhance the Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) Lir ecosystem by refining the sensor pod system. 

Starting with calibrating sensors and designing a printed circuit board that has a Micro: bit interface. This involves calibration procedures, enhancing the vehicle's ability to collect and process data.

The integration of a Micro: bit interface into the PCB aims to streamline communication between the sensors and the USV's central control system, enabling seamless data transmission and analysis.

Additionally, a custom Micro: bit library will be created in order to make it easier to program the Micro: bit sensor pod interface.

This allows both technical and non-technical people to contribute and launch their own sensor pod missions.
