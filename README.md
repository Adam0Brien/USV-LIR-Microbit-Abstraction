# Executive summary
This project carries on from the work done by the students of the SETU Applied robotics lab.
The purpose of this project is to enhance the Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) Lir ecosystem by refining the sensor pod system. 

As it stands, the USV has implemented a sensor deployment mechanism for maritime related measurements but currently the sensor pod system is in the prototype phase. This means that this aspect of the sensor deployment system has been left unfinished and needs to be worked on in order for the USV to be able to take water measurements autonomously.
  
# Proposed solution
The proposed solution is to take the current prototype of the sensor pod system and iterate on previous work done by students with the addition of making the system accessible for students by designing a micro bit library to interact with the sensor pod system.
This would allow the USV to have the functionality of taking real time measurements and open up new use cases for the platform.
